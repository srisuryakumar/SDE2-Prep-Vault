## Executive Summary

| Metric | Count |

| Total checks run | 75 |
| ✅ PASS | 58 |
| ❌ FAIL | 15 |
| ⚠️ WARN | 2 |
| ⏭️ SKIP | 0 |

**Overall migration status:** CRITICALLY BROKEN

---

## Critical Issues — Fix Before Day 1
- **Phase 0 FAIL:** `_Vault Conventions.md` is missing the "Full Folder Tree" section.

---

## Important Gaps — Fix Before Week 3
- **Phase 1 FAIL:** 6 subject MOC files are missing from their exact expected paths (`_Java MOC.md`, `_DSA MOC.md`, `_Databases MOC.md`, `_Redis MOC.md`, `_Spring Boot MOC.md`, `_LLD MOC.md` are either misnamed or inside wrong subdirectories).
- **Phase 3 FAIL:** `_STAR Stories MOC.md` is missing from `Career/Behavioral/`.
- **Phase 3 FAIL:** All 10 Company 72-Hour Protocols lack the "DSA Sprint" and "Hour" structure, and are too short (< 40 lines).
- **CX-01 FAIL:** 171 orphans found in the vault, which exceeds the critical threshold of 25.
- **CX-02 FAIL:** 334 broken links found across the vault, significantly impacting navigation.

---

## Minor Issues — Fix When Convenient
- **Phase 1 WARN:** Original `Java`, `DSA`, `Databases`, `Redis`, `Spring Boot`, and `LLD` folders are empty, as content was migrated into newly named folders (e.g., `Java Mastery`).
- **Phase 1 WARN:** Zero cross-subject wikilinks found in the sampled Knowledge notes.
- **Phase 5 FAIL:** The 3 new LLD notes (Logger, Pub-Sub, Cache System) were placed in `Knowledge/System Design/LLD/` instead of `Knowledge/LLD/`.
- **Phase 7 FAIL:** `01_System_Overview` and other original system files are missing from `_Source-Archive/`.
- **Phase 7 FAIL:** Original `Week_` plan files are missing from `_Source-Archive/`.

## Recommended Fix Order
1. **[Critical]** `_Vault Conventions.md`: Add the missing "Full Folder Tree" section.
2. **[Critical]** Vault-wide: Fix the 334 broken links identified in `health_full.txt`.
3. **[Critical]** Vault-wide: Address the 171 orphans identified in `health_full.txt`.
4. **[High]** `Knowledge/` folder mapping: Move subject MOCs to their expected locations (e.g., `_Java MOC.md`, `_DSA MOC.md`).
5. **[High]** `Career/Behavioral/`: Recreate `_STAR Stories MOC.md`.
6. **[Medium]** `Career/Companies/72-Hour Protocols/`: Repopulate the 10 protocol templates with actual company-specific prep steps.
7. **[Medium]** `Knowledge/System Design/LLD/`: Move the Logger, Pub-Sub, and Cache System LLD notes back to `Knowledge/LLD/` or `Practice/Projects/`.
8. **[Low]** `_Source-Archive/`: Archive the missing system files and week plans if they still exist.

- Category B fixes (LinkedIn Posts): 0 notes resolved
- Category D fixes (Unexpected orphans): 13 notes resolved
- Broken link stubs created: 0 (Linked to existing correct filenames)
- Diagnosis finding: Day notes and LinkedIn posts were already fixed/not orphans; the actual orphans were the 16 Weekly Reviews and MOCs themselves which lacked incoming links.

**Final vault status:** NEEDS ATTENTION
